# DALL-E-Clone
DALL-E Clone
Project Overview
DALL-E Clone is a web application that integrates OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate AI-driven images based on user input. This project is built with a full-stack approach using ReactJs, ExpressJs, NodeJs, Cloudinary, and MongoDB.

Current Status
Backend: Completed
Frontend: In Progress
Features
Backend
API Integration: Utilizes OpenAI's DALL-E API for generating images.
Storage: Integrates with Cloudinary for image storage.
Database: Uses MongoDB for storing image data and metadata.
Endpoints:
POST /generate-image: Generates an image based on user input and stores it in Cloudinary.
GET /images: Retrieves a list of generated images from the database.
Frontend
Currently under development. Will be built using ReactJs and will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the DALL-E API.
